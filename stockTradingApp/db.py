# g is a special object that is unique for each request. It is used to store data that might be accessed by multiple functions during the request. The connection is stored and reused instead of creating a new connection if get_db is called a second time in the same request.
# current_app is another special object that points to the Flask application handling the request. Since you used an application factory, there is no application object when writing the rest of your code. get_db will be called when the application has been created and is handling a request, so current_app can be used.
# sqlite3.connect() establishes a connection to the file pointed at by the DATABASE configuration key. This file doesn’t have to exist yet, and won’t until you initialize the database later.
# sqlite3.Row tells the connection to return rows that behave like dicts. This allows accessing the columns by name.
